What is the difference between Cache and a Cookie?
- Cookie - used to store user details.
    - Cookies often track information like how frequently the user visits, what are the times of visits, what banners have been clicked on, 
      what button clicked, user preferences, items in shopping cart, etc.
    - Example would be youtube, or facebook. They show ads based on the information available in your cookies.lets say you visited amazon.com 
      and you were looking into some shoes, and after some time you open up a facebook page you would have noticed that facebook would show ads 
      related to shoes in their page how is that done. well this is where cookie comes of use.

- Cache - used to store information to render the page faster.
     - For example, when you open websites with large pictures and videoâ€™s or a page with huge data that takes some time to render in front of 
      you, it might take some time to load the website. Here we can use cache to stores the site contents like the images, videos, audio, huge 
      data etc. on your computer. So the next time you load the same website you will find it loading faster.

- Both cookie and cache can have an expiry time limit, depending upon ur business needs.
